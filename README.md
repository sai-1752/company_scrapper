# Company Website Scraper – DT Assignment

## Overview
This is a lightweight website scraper designed to extract structured company information
from publicly accessible web pages. The tool focuses on reliability, transparency, and
decision-usable output rather than exhaustive scraping.

The scraper takes a single website URL as input and returns a structured JSON object
containing company identity, offerings, proof signals, and contact information.
